            I'm a security-focused technologist with experience in IT infrastructure and cloud platforms. When I'm not hardening and breaking into systems or automating security protocols, you'll find me researching cybersecurity threats, creating solutions to cloud issues, increasing my knowledge through personalized learning, and building practical tools for real-world problems.  
            This site serves as my digital notebook â€” where I can share knowledge, projects, and thoughts about our evolving tech landscape.
