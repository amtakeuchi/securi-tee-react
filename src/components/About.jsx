            I'm a security-focused technologist with experience in IT infrastructure and cloud platforms. When I'm not hardening and breaking into systems or automating security protocols, you'll find me: 
              - 🔒 Researching emerging cybersecurity threats  
              - ☁️ Architecting cloud-native solutions  
              - 📝 Increasing my knowledge through personalized learning  
              - ⚡ Building practical tools for real-world problems  
            This site serves as my digital notebook — sharing knowledge, projects, and thoughts about our evolving tech landscape.
